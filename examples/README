These examples originated from these sources:

* http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SnuspLanguage
* http://rosettacode.org/wiki/SNUSP

Indeed the original code for this interpreter came from the c2 wiki.

I have modified things slightly to fix bugs and make the interpreter more
understandable and maintainable. Most of the tweaks to the examples were simply
to make the return code be 0.
